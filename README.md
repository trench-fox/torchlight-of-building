## Want to contribute? 

* Reach out to me on discord. I am aclinia on the torchlight infinite.
* I am not currently accepting code contributions until I am able to put the project in a better state and have bandwidth to onboard contributors.
* However, when I do begin accepting them...
  * All code contributions MUST BE MANUALLY VERIFIED FOR CORRECTNESS by the author. I don't care if you hand write or use AI, it has to be good code quality and correct.
  * I will not be accepting code contributions that affect core system infrastructure, such as the calculation scaffolding, as it is too important and I need to maintain a good mental model of it for now
  * Currently, the easiest ways to help would probably be: creating more affix templates, supporting new mods in the existing calculation framework, adding data overrides for when tlidb is incorrect.
