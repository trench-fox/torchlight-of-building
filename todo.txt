I want to make a single page application, which will serve as a charcter build planner for the game, Torchlight Infinite.
In essence, this website will allow a user to select different things like their gear, skills, talents, etc and see different calculations, including their estimated DPS, defences, stats, etc.
This is heavily inspired off of Path of Building, a community made tool for Path of Exile.
I care much more for functionality and UX than an extremely polished UI, though any easy improvements there are welcome.
You can delete or modify any of the existing code in src/app - this is the default template taken from nextjs.
For now, I just want the ability to 

I want to implement the TalentPage, which is a bit like a passive tree. The data for all the talent trees is contained within the data/ directory, with each file representing a different tree.
Some rules for the talent tree:
* A player may select up to four talent trees
* The first talent tree must be one of the god or goddess trees, and none of the remaining 3 may be god or goddess trees
* Each column requires at least (column * 3) points allocated total in the columns before it
  * For example, the first column requires 0 points allocated, while the 4th column will require 9 points allocated in the tree
* If a node has a pre-requisite, then the pre-requisite node must have all points allocated up to its max points
For now, implement a RawTalentPage interface, which stores 


Actual TODOs:
Maybe have separate mod union for micro/medium talent mods, so that they're easily scalable with points?
Input crafting options from tlidb (how to handle and where to put affix ranges). Probably just a list per equipment type or whatever?


I want you to implement the frontend for the talent page.
Some talent page rules and information:
* A player may select up to four talent trees
* The first talent tree must be one of the god or goddess trees, and none of the remaining 3 may be god or goddess trees
* Each talent tree can be thought of as a 7 column, 5 row blank grid. 
* Each column requires at least (column * 3) points allocated total in the columns before it
  * For example, the first column requires 0 points allocated, while the 4th column will require 9 points allocated in the tree
* If a node has a pre-requisite, then the pre-requisite node must have all points allocated up to its max points
* Each talent tree's data can be found in data/*_tree.json
* information for building the web view:
  * Position is 0 indexed, starting at top left. x is column, y is row
  * iconName determines which icon to display, each of which can be found in public/tli/talents
  * a line should be drawn between a node and its pre-requisite, if any
  * there should be a number or ratio, representing allocated points / max points for each node
  * users should be able to add or remove points from a node, using a + or - button on each node
  * the top of each column should have the number of points required to allocate points in that column, e.g. 0 above the first row, 3 above the second, etc
  * each node's tooltip should show the type of talent, e.g. "Medium Talent", and its raw affix
  * the user's talent page allocations should be saved into the RawLoadout object, that's already being used for saving user data
